Now that we have login working, it is a good idea to adapt it to the different scenarios, for example
* For the patient, we should a login page with registration, and when they are registered, only manager can access their activation, they shouldnt confirm it themselves
* For the doctor, we should remove registraion, as doctor's account is created by admin

We can specify that user keys are int's so that we can take int from user and apply to patient/doctor/manager info.
